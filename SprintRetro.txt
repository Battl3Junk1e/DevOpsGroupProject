Sprint Retrospective â€“ DevOps Pipeline Project

What went well:
We communicated effectively through regular Discord meetings and managed to split the tasks fairly among team members. 
Everyone contributed equally, and we made steady progress throughout the sprint. Working with GitHub repositories was smooth thanks to good collaboration and support within the team.

What could have gone better:
It was some of our first times using GitHub, so there was a bit of a learning curve at the start. However, the team was helpful and guided me through the process, which made it easier to get on track.

Future improvements:
In future sprints, we could document our work on GitHub workflows more clearly, for example "commit" messages can be clearer. This would improve readability for outside users and reviewers.
